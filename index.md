This course aims to teach in a Nordic framework the next generation of scientists to integrate different eScience tools and infrastructures to achieve a more holistic interpretation of the climate system and its components through model and data analysis. The focus of the course is on the application of eScience tools, but applied to climate and air quality research at high northern latitudes.  

The course is supported by [Nordforsk (Nordic eScience Globalisation Initiative; NeGI)](https://www.nordforsk.org/en/programmes-and-projects/programmes/escience-globaliseringsinitiativ), the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) ([course GEO4990](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/geofag/GEO4990/index.html)), [eSTICC](https://esticc.net/), [Bolin Centre for Climate Research](https://bolin.su.se/) and the [CHESS Research School](https://chess.w.uib.no/).
